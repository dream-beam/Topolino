This repository is a Python toolkit for exploring paraxial wave propagation and related optical phenomena.  At its core is an Fresnel propagator (`propTF`) that works with NumPy’s FFT to propagate a complex field through space.  The package includes routines for generating Gaussian beams, extracting the RMS beam radius from intensity moments, and directly comparing the numerical propagation to the analytical Gaussian‑beam law $\($ \sigma(z)=\sqrt{\sigma_{0}^{2}+(\theta z)^{2}} $\)$ with $\theta=\lambda/(4\pi\sigma_{0}) $.  A collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrates a range of topics: a thin‑lens model, the creation and propagation of spiral beams, the diffraction pattern of transmission gratings, and a full simulation of a grating‑experiment setup that includes a light source, propagation to a grating, and observation of the resulting orders. The notebooks guide the user through parameters (wavelength, aperture size, grating period, vortex charge, etc.), visualise results with 1‑D plots, RMS‑size versus distance curves, and 2‑D intensity maps, and provide direct side‑by‑side comparisons with analytical predictions wherever available.
